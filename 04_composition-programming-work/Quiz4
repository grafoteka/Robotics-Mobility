1. How many virtual legs are used in a quadrupedal walk? (refer: 3.2.2)

	Solution: 2 -> WRONG
	Solution: 4

2. How many virtual legs are used by a hopping kangaroo? 
	
	Solution: 1 -> CORRECT

3. Suppose the cartoon robot below is in stance (toe is pinned to the ground), and a hip torque is applied in the direction of the arrow. Then:

	a) the leg will rotate in the counterclockwise direction, the body will not experience any moments
	b) the body will experience a counterclockwise moment
	c) the leg will rotate in the clockwise direction, the body will not experience any moments
	d) the body will experience a clockwise moment -> CORRECT

4. Assume all the virtual or physical toes are in stance (i.e. pinned to the ground). The arrows in the left figure are physical leg extension forces, and the arrow in the right figure is a virtual hip torque. Note that this counterclockwise virtual hip torque would result in a clockwise acceleration of the body.

To apply the shown virtual hip torque on the right, in the physical model on the left,

	a) both legs should apply the same extension force -> INCORRECT
	b) the left leg should apply a higher extension force
	c) this is not possible without using physical hip torques -> INCORRECT
	d) the right leg should apply a higher extension force -> INCORRECT

5. Assume the physical robot on the left is in stance. The equivalent "virtual leg" is shown in the image on the right. In this question we think about how physical torques can move the virtual hip. Assume that a torque in the direction of the arrows is positive.

Imagine the right physical hip applies 0 Nm. Then, a torque of 1 Nm applied by the left physical hip moves the virtual hip to the left. Similarly, if the left hip applies −1 Nm and the right hip applies 0 Nm, the virtual hip moves to the right.

Which of the following would translate the pivot point of the virtual hip to the left?

	a) Left hip applies 2 Nm, right hip applies −1 Nm. -> CORRECT
	b) The left toe is positioned further left in flight -> INCORECT
	c) Left hip applies 1 Nm, right hip applies −1 Nm.
	d) Left hip applies −2 Nm, right hip applies 1 Nm.

/*** MATLAB: composition of vertical hoppers				   ***/
**********************************************************/
1. We have made a very simplistic MATLAB simulation with a Minitaur-like body and a composition of identical, independent vertical hoppers. This means that in the simulation, each leg is controlled as if it were a vertical hopper, and the controllers are truly decoupled.

The following questions should help you see the power of this kind of composition, and also how the body design might affect behavior.
avikHW.zip

Download the zip file, and run the script "avikHW.m". You must set the parameters (as described below) and click "run" to run the simulation and display the plots.

What is the symbolic name of the parameter that controls vertical hopper height (according to the slide in 0:35--1:40 of 4.2.2?) Hint: it is a single letter!

	Solution: a -> INCORRECT

2. Select d=0.2 and leave it for the following three questions.

Increasing the gain from 0, with d=0.2, find the smallest value of vertical hopper gain such that both of the vertical hoppers have sustained bounces.

Hint: look at the hybrid mode plot; "3" means that both legs are in stance. Make sure that the system doesn't settle in to mode 3 after a few bounces; i.e., modes other than 3 (when either vertical hopper has some aerial phase) are visible till the end of the simulation. 

	Solution: 12	-> CORRECT

3. With d=0.2, find a value of VH gain such that "bounding" occurs, i.e. the vertical hoppers get out of sync, and there is no double stance (i.e. the hybrid mode does not reach 3 after a few initial bounces)

	Solution: 26	-> INCORRECT

4. With d=0.2, what is the value of VH gain such that the equilibrium z (of the CoM) is ≈0.2.

	Solution: 36	-> CORRECT

5. Now we shall see how the body dynamics (specifically, as parameterized by the length of the body) affects our composition. Change to d=0.1 and leave it for the following three questions.

With d=0.1, find a value of vertical hopper gain such that ”bounding” occurs, i.e. the vertical hoppers get out of sync, and there is no double stance (i.e. the hybrid mode does not reach 3 after a few initial bounces).

Note: You will observe that the shorter body does not like to passively desynchronize the vertical hoppers as well as the longer body...telling us that more active desynchronization is needed (not implemented in this simulation).

	Solution: 10 -> INCORRECT

6. With d=0.1, what is the value of vertical hopper gain such that the equilibrium z (of the CoM) is ≈0.2?

Note: it might oscillate about this value unless you run the simulation for a longer time, but try to guess the steady-state value it is converging to.

	Solution: 40	-> CORRECT

/*** 4.3.4 Transitions															   ***/
**********************************************************/
1. To get some idea of the ground reaction complex (GRC), take the example of an n-legged stool being dropped to the ground, and assume that as it falls, contacts can be made but never broken (i.e. if a leg touches the ground it doesn’t lift off again), and also that there are no “simultaneous” contacts. Define the “sitting” mode as the one where all legs are in contact.

Define the term "word" as a sequence of contact modes in a transitional behavior. For example, 000→001→011→111 is a single word comprised of 4 letters (contact modes). For further reference into the vocabulary analogy take a look at

https://repository.upenn.edu/ese_papers/662/

How many possible “words” are there from aerial to sitting for n=2?

	Solution: 2 -> CORRECT

2. (Same setup as previous question) How many words are there from aerial to sitting for n=3?

	Solution: 6
	15 -> INCORRECT
	16 -> INCORRECT
	9 -> INCORRECT
	18 -> INCORRECT

3. The three digits inside the robot are a binary string representing current contact mode, with 1 signifying an active contact, and 0 and inactive one. If “LB = left body, RB = right body, T = toe”, the correct sequence of labels is

	a) LB,RB,T
	b) LB,T,RB -> CORRECT
	c) RB,LB,T
	d) T,LB,RB

Assuming the contact labels are in the sequence {nose, leg, rear, tail}, which of these is the correct completion of the leap word corresponding to the video clip?

Hint: think about which contacts are the last to break?

	a) 0001→0000 -> CORRECT
	b) 0100→0000
	c) 0111→0000
	d) 0010→0000
