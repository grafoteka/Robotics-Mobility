/*** QUIZ 2.1.1 Walking like a rimless wheel				   ***/
**********************************************************/
	1. Energetic cost of transport is a measure commonly used to evaluate the energetic efficiency of robotic locomotion, and is given by the energy needed to travel a given distance with a robot, divided by the energy needed to lift the robot the same distance vertically against gravity. Which of the below trigonometric relations gives the energetic cost of transport (COT) for the rimless wheel powered by gravity as a function of ramp angle? Use the horizontal distance traveled in your calculations to represent distance traveled.

		a) COT = Sin(rampAngle)
		b) COT = Cos(rampAngle)
		✔c) COT = Tan(rampAngle) -> CORRECT
		d) COT = Csc(rampAngle)
		e) COT = Sec(rampAngle)
		f) COT = Cot(rampAngle)

	2. The Cornell Ranger has a mass of 9.91 kg and walked a total distance of 65,243 m using 1,774,800 J of battery energy. What is the cost of transport for the Cornell Ranger? Assume a gravitational acceleration of 9.81 m/s^2 in calculating your answer.
		
		✔0.28
		
		COT = E / mgd; E = Energy input of the system, m = mass, d = distance, g = standard gravity.
		COT = 1774800/(9.91*9.81*65243) = 0.27981

	3. What ramp angle is required to give a cost of transport of 0.2 for the rimless wheel, which is approximately equal to the efficiency of human walking?

		a) 6 degrees
		✔b) 11 degrees -> CORRECT
		c) 31 degrees
		d) 45 degrees
		解释：arctan(0.2)=11
		
	4. We've seen that energy is often used very efficiently for movement in biology as compared to in robots. The cost of storing energy (in terms of weight) is another factor that comes into play in determining locomotion ability -- the more weight is stored in fuel, the more mass the actuators need to move! Let's compare how much it weights to store a given amount of energy in biological fuel -- i.e. food -- as compared with electricity to power a robot.
	How many kg of battery weight would it be necessary for a human-like robot to walk a marathon? Assume that a marathon takes 5960 KJ to walk (this is an extremely roughly estimate assuming a 72 kg person walking it with a energetic cost of transport of 0.2), and that the lithium polymer batteries have a mass of 0.002kg per KJ of energy storage. Round to the nearest kilogram.
	Just to put this in perspective, this same energy can be contained in less than 7 candy bars, which have a total weight of less than 0.4kg!
		
		✔12
		Energy required for marathon * KJ per battery = 5960KJ * 0.002 KJ per battery = 11.92 -> 12KG.

	1. Given a robot with a leg length of 0.4m, what is the estimated maximum possible walking speed in meters per second according to the Froude number? Assume an acceleration due to gravity of 10m/s^2.
		
		✔2
		Fr = v² / g·l -> v = sqrt(Fr·g·l), donde Fr < 1 para correr y Fr > 1 para caminar
		Por tanto, v = 2

	2. Assume that the energetically optimal walk-to-run transition speed for a robotic biped occurs at a Froude number of 0.5. What is the expression for the optimal speed of transitioning from walking to running in terms of leg length d? Assume a gravitational acceleration of 10m/s^2. Enter you answer in simplest form, using sqrt() to represent any square roots. (Ex: The square root of 2*d is written as sqrt(2*d)).

		✔v = sqrt(5·d)

	3. Which of the following energy plots best represents the energy during stance of the center-of-mass of a robot running with SLIP-like dynamics?

	1. Today's quiz will tune the Raibert hopper in Matlab. As a first step, this question covers tuning the vertical hopping behavior.
	
	If you haven't yet set up the Matlab environment, we have a course resource titled "Setting up MATLAB" here. If you have not worked with Matlab before, there are also 2 tutorials provided in Week 1 to that should provide a sufficient introduction to Matlab to allow you to complete the quiz questions.

	Quiz_2_1_1_Raibert_Hopper.zip

	Download the MATLAB file called Quiz_2_1_1_Raibert_Hopper. You run the simulation by running Quiz_2_1_1_Question_1 with no arguments.

	Your first task is to tune the thrust duration using the slider so that the hopper reaches a steady state hopping height between 1m and 1.1m (denoted by the horizontal green and red lines in the generated plot) at the end of the simulation. Give the resulting thrust duration in seconds that meets these goals as your answer.

		✔0.00071429

	2. Now we will tune the forward speed controller. You run the simulation by running Quiz_2_1_1_Question_2 with no arguments.

	Recall that the neutral point is estimated at each step, and that the forward speed controller consists of a proportional controller that puts the toe in front of or behind the neutral point to obtain the desired speed. What proportional gain to the forward speed controller causes the robot to accelerate from rest to a speed between 0.9 m/s and 1.1 m/s without ever going over 1.1 m/s?

		✔0.087439

	3. Now we will tune the pitch controller to achieve a desired pitch of π12 radians. You run the simulation by running Quiz_2_1_1_Question_3 with no arguments.

	Your task is to finish writing the PD controller contained in pitchController.m. Keep a derivative term of kd_phi = 5. What value of kp_phi bounds the pitch within the green and red lines in the graph generated by the simulation?
		
		✔5
		
		En el script pitchController.m

		function Tphi = pitchController(phi,phiDesired,dphi_dt)
		kd_phi = 5;
		kp_phi = 3.75;

		Tphi = (kp_phi) * (phiDesired - phi) + (kd_phi) * (0 - dphi_dt);

	4. Now we will put all 3 controller parts together. You run the simulation by running Quiz_2_1_1_Question_4 with no arguments.

	In this simulation you combine the 3 previous controllers. Can you make the robot move how you want it to? The intention of this question is just for you to gain some intuition regarding how these controllers interact, and to have some fun seeing that very simple controllers can get the robot to move robustly. When you are done, simply enter 42 as the answer below.

2.2.1 Metrics and Scaling: mass, length, strength
	1. If a cube's side length is doubled, what happens to its perimeter, surface area, and volume?
		a) Perimeter: 2x
			 Area: 2x
			 Volume: 4x
		b) Perimeter: 2x
		 	 Area: 2x
			 Volume: 2x
		✔c) Perimeter: 2x -> CORRECT
			 Area: 4x
			 Volume: 8x
		d) Perimeter: 2x

			 Volume: 8x

	2. A small ice cube with side length L and a larger ice cube of length 2L are left sitting out in the sun. If the small ice cube takes 10 minutes to melt, how long will the large one take, in minutes?

	Hint: You don't need to know anything about thermodynamics to solve this; heat transfer (the rate at which the ice cube heats up) is proportional to the surface area of the ice cube, and thermal mass (the amount of heat required to melt the ice cube) is proportional to volume. We assume that the melting time is proportional to this ratio. 

		Solution: 20 -> 10 minutes * Volume / Area

	3. If a larger bone in a larger animal is 3x longer than a smaller bone in a smaller animal, and compressive stress in both bones is the same, how many times thicker must the larger bone be?

	Hint: stress is mass divided by area. Assuming constant density of the animals, mass is proportional to volume. Also assume that the volume scales with length^3. Remember that the primary compression occurs axially along the length of the bone. How much larger must the thickness be to maintain the same (mass)/(cross sectional area) ratio?

	Correct answers should be submitted with one decimal place, (e.g, 23.5)
	
		✔0.11

		El volumen aumenta por 3 veces también. 
		V = 3*3*3 = 27 -> sqrt(V) = 5.19 ~ 5.2

	 ✔3.04 -> CORRECT
	 
	F = (EA/L0)*ðL -> F*L0 = E * pi * r² -> r = sqrt(F*L0/(E*pi));
	r[m] = sqrt(5000*0.1/(69*pi)) = 1.51[m]
	r[mm] = 1518.7[mm]
	----
	d = sqrt((4*K*L)/(E*pi));
	Ø = 3.037494611[mm]
